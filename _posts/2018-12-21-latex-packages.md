Most economists in training are familiar with the basics of LaTeX for clean math typesetting. Many have probably already used LaTeX for a problem set or similar assignment, or even a short paper. In fact, LaTeX is an extremely versatile software, and with the proper techniques you can create stunning papers, slides, and reports. But as your research becomes more independent and complex, you may find yourself spending an inordinate amount of time getting LaTeX to do exactly what you want. 

In many cases, formatting and presentation issues are solved using particular packages, which contain additional functions and syntax you can use. Almost all of these packages are user-submitted, so there are *many* packages you could use. (The complete directory of packages is [here](https://ctan.org/pkg?lang=en).) Here, I highlight my top *N* favorite LaTeX packages for economics papers, a list of others I commonly use. I also include an easy function for you to copy/paste the packages you select for your next project. 

This post is not intended to be an introduction to LaTeX for social scientists %mdash; for that, I recommend John Frain's book [*Applied LATEX for Economists, Social Scientists and Others*](http://www.tcd.ie/Economics/TEP/2014/TEP0214.pdf). Chapter 8 includes some more ideas of useful packages (with some overlap).
