Every so often I like to try my hand at creative writing (check out [my CV](http://alex-hoagland.github.io/cv/) for some examples). This is especially true when I'm in the bogged down stage of coding and re-coding analysis for too many research projects, and miss writing. 

So, [here](http://alex-hoagland.github.io/files/From_Infinity_to_Infinity.pdf) is a recent essay of mine, born as a way to procrastinate my current projects. Sorry, advisors!
