Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the University of Toronto's Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation in the Dalla Lana School of Public Health. I received my PhD in Economics from Boston University in May 2022. [You can download my CV here](http://alex-hoagland.github.io/files/HoaglandCV_current.pdf).

My primary field is health economics, with additional research in industrial organization and applied econometrics. My research focuses on the role of information and behavioral biases in (a) the take-up of high-value care by consumers and (b) the adoption of innovative health technologies by providers. Details about my publications, working papers, grants, and teaching experience are available on this site.
