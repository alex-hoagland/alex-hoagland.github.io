Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at Boston University, I am on the 2021-2022 economics/health policy job market, and I will be available for interviews around the AAEA, APPAM, EEA, and ASSA meetings. [You can download my CV here](http://alex-hoagland.github.io/files/HoaglandCV_current.pdf).

My primary fields is health economics, with additional research in industrial organization and applied econometrics. My research centers around questions of how to improve access to and utilization of high-value health services, such as preventive care, for at-risk individuals and families. My job market paper focuses on how these at-risk households respond to information about their risks and evaluates the welfare associated with such choices. My other ongoing and published projects span multiple related questions, ranging from the costs associated with preventive care utilization to the use of care for specific at-risk populations, including those living with mental illness and providers treating cardiovascular disease. 

I received Bachelor's degrees in economics and mathematics from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, where I was privileged to work with economists and legislators in projects exploring adolescent well-being, vehicle safety inspections, and political philosophy.

I currently live in Arlington, MA, with my wife Kristen, who is also studying at Boston University (pursuing a degree in Chaplaincy).
