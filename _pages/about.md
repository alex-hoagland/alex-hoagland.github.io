Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at Boston University, I am on the 2021-2022 economics/health policy job market, and I will be available for virtual interviews around the ASSA 2022 annual meeting, or by appointment. [You can download my CV here](http://alex-hoagland.github.io/files/HoaglandCV_current.pdf).

My primary field is health economics, with additional research in industrial organization and applied econometrics. My research focuses on the role of individual decision-making—including behavioral biases—in (a) the take-up of high-value care by consumers and (b) the adoption of innovative health technologies by providers. My job market paper, [“An Ounce of Prevention or a Pound of Cure? The Value of Health Risk Information"](https://alex-hoagland.github.io/files/Hoagland_BU_JMPHealthInfo.pdf) shows that individuals infer information about their health risks by observing family health events, but that overreactions in these inferences lead to welfare penalties and propagate the use of low-return health services. 

My other ongoing and published projects span related questions ranging from the costs associated with preventive care utilization to the use of care for specific at-risk populations, including those living with mental illness and providers treating cardiovascular disease. Details about my publications, working papers, and teaching experience are available on this site. 

I received Bachelor's degrees in economics and mathematics from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Details about my undergraduate research are also available on this website. I currently live in Arlington, MA, with my wife Kristen.
