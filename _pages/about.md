I am an aspiring health economist pursuing a PhD in economics from Boston University. I am currently in my second year, beginning research that focuses on the gaps between academic research and health practices, particularly within mental health care. My goal as an economist and researcher is to re-connect academia and the public. 

I received Bachelor's degrees in economics and mathematics from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. I currently live in Arlington, MA, with my wife Kristen, who is pursuing a degree in Chaplaincy from BU as well. We stay sane with frequent camping trips and baking way too many goodies.
