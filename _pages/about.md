Welcome to my website! I am an aspiring health economist, currently in the fourth year of an economics PhD from Boston University. My fields are health economics and industrial organization. [You can download my CV here](http://alex-hoagland.github.io/files/HoaglandCV_current.pdf)

My current projects span a variety of issues ranging from chronic illness and mental health management to innovation in health care. In particular, I am currently working on projects studying how consumers form beliefs about their health needs, the impact of behavioral decision-making processes for chronic disease management, and the response of hyper-specialized professionals such as surgeons to disruptive innovations in their field. 

I received Bachelor's degrees in economics and mathematics from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, where I was privileged to work with amazing economists and legislators in projects exploring adolescent well-being, vehicle safety inspections, and political philosophy. You can learn more about each of these projects on this website.

I currently live in Arlington, MA, with my wife Kristen, who is also studying at Boston University (pursuing a degree in Chaplaincy). We have a young daughter, Gwendowlyn, and are staying sane by taking frequent camping trips and baking way too many goodies.
