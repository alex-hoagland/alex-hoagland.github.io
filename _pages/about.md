Welcome to my website! I am a health economist, in the process of receiving my PhD from Boston University. My fields are health economics and industrial organization. [You can download my CV here](http://alex-hoagland.github.io/files/HoaglandCV_current.pdf).

My research centers around questions of how to improve access to and utilization of high-value health services, such as preventive care, for at-risk individuals and families. My job market paper focuses on how these at-risk households respond to information about their risks and evaluates the welfare associated with such choices. My other ongoing and published projects span a issues ranging from costs associated with preventive care utilization to specific at-risk populations, including innovations in treatments for cardiovascular disease and mental health conditions. My research has been published in top journals, including _JAMA Network Open_. 

I received Bachelor's degrees in economics and mathematics from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, where I was privileged to work with amazing economists and legislators in projects exploring adolescent well-being, vehicle safety inspections, and political philosophy. You can learn more about each of these projects on this website.

I currently live in Arlington, MA, with my wife Kristen, who is also studying at Boston University (pursuing a degree in Chaplaincy). We have a young daughter, Gwendowlyn, and are staying sane by taking frequent camping trips and baking way too many goodies.
