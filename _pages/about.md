Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at Boston University, graduating in May 2022. In July, I will be joining the University of Toronto's Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation in the Dalla Lana School of Public Health. [You can download my CV here](http://alex-hoagland.github.io/files/HoaglandCV_current.pdf).

My primary field is health economics, with additional research in industrial organization and applied econometrics. My research focuses on the role of information and behavioral biases in (a) the take-up of high-value care by consumers and (b) the adoption of innovative health technologies by providers. My job market paper, [â€œAn Ounce of Prevention or a Pound of Cure? The Value of Health Risk Information"](https://alex-hoagland.github.io/files/Hoagland_BU_JMPHealthInfo.pdf) shows that individuals infer information about their health risks by observing family health events, but that overreactions in these inferences lead to welfare penalties and propagate the use of low-return health services. 

My other ongoing and published projects span related questions ranging from the costs associated with preventive care utilization to the use of care for specific at-risk populations, including those living with mental illness and providers treating cardiovascular disease. Details about my publications, working papers, and teaching experience are available on this site. 

I received Bachelor's degrees in economics and mathematics from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. I currently live in Arlington, MA, with my wife Kristen.
