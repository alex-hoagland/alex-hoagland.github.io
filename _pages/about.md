Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at Boston University, I am on the 2021-2022 economics/health policy job market, and I will be available for virtual interviews around the ASSA 2022 annual meeting, or by appointment. [You can download my CV here](http://alex-hoagland.github.io/files/HoaglandCV_current.pdf).

My primary field is health economics, with additional research in industrial organization and applied econometrics. I conduct research answering questions of how to improve access to and utilization of high-value health services, such as preventive care, for at-risk individuals and families. My job market paper focuses on how these at-risk households experiencing new chronic diagnoses respond to information about their risks. Specifically, I assess the role of informational spillovers in overall health spending, the consumption of low-value care, and household welfare. My other ongoing and published projects span related questions ranging from the costs associated with preventive care utilization to the use of care for specific at-risk populations, including those living with mental illness and providers treating cardiovascular disease. 

I received Bachelor's degrees in economics and mathematics from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Details about my undergraduate research are also avaialble on this website. I currently live in Arlington, MA, with my wife Kristen, who is also studying at Boston University (pursuing a degree in Chaplaincy).
