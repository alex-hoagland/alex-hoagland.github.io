excerpt: 'Individuals learn about their health risks from witnessing family health experiences. I assess how the (mis)-interpretation of this risk information limits the potential welfare gains from informational spillovers, using household health shocks as quasi-random risk signals. Adverse health events generate strong, persistent spillover effects within a family, increasing spending by about 10% annually among unaffected household members. I show that these responses are more consistent with households reevaluating their health risks than other potential mechanisms; however, responses include increased utilization of both high- and low-return services. To evaluate welfare effects, I estimate a structural model of health choices in which individuals learn about their health risks as health events reveal information. The model suggests that consumers over-respond to health information by over-weighting their health risks, resulting in welfare losses averaging $2,788. Placing bounds on how consumers update their beliefs in response to risk information improves welfare for 86% of households. My analysis suggests that the revelation of health risk information can be optimally targeted on household demographics to improve social welfare gains.'

Differences in eligibility criteria for women seeking Medicaid coverage before and after birth create an “enrollment cliff” in which many women who qualified for Medicaid while pregnant lose coverage sixty days following their delivery. In this working paper, we use a regression-discontinuity design to assess the effects of losing this coverage on health service use and insurance enrollment outcomes. Women who lost their eligibility subsequently experienced more gaps and disruptions to their insurance coverage, resulting in fewer services and worse health outcomes.
