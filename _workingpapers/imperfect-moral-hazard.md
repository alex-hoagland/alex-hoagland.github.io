title: "What's in a Bill? A Model of Imperfect Moral Hazard in Health Care"
collection: workingpapers
permalink: /workingpapers/imperfect-moral-hazard
excerpt: 'A central problem in the optimal design of health insurance is medical price sensitivity among consumers. However, delays in when pricing information is communicated to consumers may create distortions in consumption choices. We study spillover household responses to scheduled medical services before and after a medical bill arrives, leveraging variation in the time an insurer takes to process a claim. Immediately after services, non-diagnosed household spending increases by roughly 60%; however, a bill's arrival causes a reduction in spending by 8.5%, nearly 15% of the increase. Importantly, responses are not entirely comprised of strategic delays in care; a bill also affects where consumers seek care even for non-delayable services, such as hospital care for respiratory infections. Our results suggest households learn pricing information from a bill: our effects are much larger when the bill communicates that a household is just shy of meeting a deductible. We model how households form beliefs about marginal prices, and find households overestimate their expenditures by 10% prior to a bill. Policy simulations show that novel plan designs---such as shortening deductible periods---may stabilize consumption trajectories.'
