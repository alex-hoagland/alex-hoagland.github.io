(joint work with Randall P. Ellis, Jeffrey Siracuse, Allan Walkey, Karen Lasser, Brian Jacobson, Corinne Andriola, Ying Liu, Chenlu Song, Tzu-Chun Kuo, & Arlene Ash). In 2015, the United States transitioned from using the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) to the 10th Revision, prompting an over seven-fold increase in diagnostic detail. In this paper, we leverage this refinement of detail to create a new diagnostic classification system---called **Diagnostic Items (DXI)**. We show that using these new DXI improves risk adjustment models and can improve provider payment schemes. 

The full abstract/text of this paper is not available as it is currently prepared for submission at clinical journals that do not allow online circulation of working papers. Look for more detail about this paper coming soon.
