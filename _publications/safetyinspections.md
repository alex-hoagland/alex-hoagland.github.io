excerpt: 'Abstract: Improvements in vehicle technology mean that vehicles are safer and more reliable than in the past. Accordingly, some states have begun to discontinue their requirements for vehicle safety inspections. To gauge the effect of these policy changes, we examine traffic fatality data from 2000 to 2015, with emphasis on New Jersey, which ended its inspection requirements in 2010. Through a synthetic controls approach and difference-in-differences analysis, we conclude that this policy change did not result in an increase in the frequency or intensity of accidents due to car failure.'
