excerpt: 'How can diagnostic information in ICD-10-CM be organized to improve the accuracy and usefulness of predictive models used for plan payment and disease surveillance? In this study, we create new diagnostic items using ICD-10-CM codes that achieved a validated R2 almost 1.5 times that of Affordable Care Act Marketplace risk-adjustment model, with meaningful improvements for other outcomes. Rich multidimensional diagnostic classification systems can improve predictive models for performance benchmarking and risk adjustment.'

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) is a novel, cost-effective method for treating aortic stenosis (AS). Knowledge gaps between specialists and general physicians (GPs) are a critical problem facing innovation dissemination, implicitly limiting access to novel technologies like TAVI when patients need GP diagnoses or referrals before accessing care. GPs may learn about innovations from medical education or national coverage guidelines but are more likely influenced by direct patient experiences. This cohort study compared GP treatment of AS patients around completed TAVI interventions among their patients.
