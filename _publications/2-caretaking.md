*Abstract*: Sibling interactions play important roles in socialization; however, little is known about sibling caretaking in contemporary families. This study examined the prevalence of adolescents providing care for younger siblings and the quality of care as associated with a broad spectrum of contextual, individual, microsystem and macrosystem factors. Relying on nationally representative time diary data from the American Time Use Survey, we found that factors at all levels (contextual, individual, microsystem and macrosystem) were associated with sibling caretaking. The caretakerâ€™s sex and the ages and sexes of younger siblings correlated with the incidence and quality of sibling care. Boys more often cared for younger brothers, and girls more often cared for younger sisters. In addition, boys more often played with younger siblings while girls more often provided physical care and talked with younger siblings, mirroring
gendered patterns seen in parents.

Data & Methods
-----
We analyzed time use for 5,170 adolescents between the ages of 15 and 18 using the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). We tested two separate models, one for the prevalence, and one for the quality of sibling caretaking. The first model addressed how contextual and individual factors associated with the prevalence of sibling care? The second model is a regression-based analysis of the quality of sibling caretaking.
