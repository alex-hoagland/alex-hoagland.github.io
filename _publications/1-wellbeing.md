excerpt: 'Adolescents spend more time outside of the home as they interact more with friends, neighbors and mentors. These interactions play a prominent role in long-run adolescent development, and could potentially compensate for a lack of interaction with parents and family members for adolescents from non-nuclear homes. This study contributes the first data-driven study of the immediate emotional response of adolescents from varying home structures as they spend time with friends, mentors, and other adults in their community.'

Adolescents spend more time outside of the home as they interact more with friends, neighbors and mentors. These interactions play a prominent role in long-run adolescent development, and could potentially compensate for a lack of interaction with parents and family members for adolescents from non-nuclear homes. This study contributes the first data-driven study of the immediate emotional response of adolescents from varying home structures as they spend time with friends, mentors, and other adults in their community.

Summary:
=====
*Abstract*: Adolescents spend an increasing percentage of time outside of the home as they age, spending more of their time with friends, neighbors and mentors. These social and community interactions play a prominent role in long-run adolescent development, and could potentially go so far as to compensate for a lack of interaction with parents and family members for adolescents from non-nuclear homes. This study contributes the first data-driven study identifying the immediate emotional response of adolescents from varying home structures—nuclear homes, stepparent homes, and single-parent homes—as they spend time with friends, mentors, and other adults in their community.
