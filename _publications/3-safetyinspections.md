An increase in technology means that vehicles are more reliable than in the past. Accordingly, states have begun to discontinue their requirements for vehicle safety inspections. To gauge the effect of such changes, we examine traffic fatality data from 2000 to 2015, with emphasis on New Jersey, which ended safety inspection requirements in 2010.

*Abstract*: An increase in technology means that vehicles are more reliable than in the past. Accordingly, states have begun to discontinue their requirements for vehicle safety inspections. To gauge the effect of such changes, we examine traffic fatality data from 2000 to 2015, with emphasis on New Jersey, which ended safety inspection requirements in 2010. Utilizing a synthetic controls approach, we conclude that ending these requirements did not result in a significant increase in the frequency or intensity of accidents due to car failure, implying that the consumer and government expenditures used for inspections could be reallocated to other areas of travel safety.

Data & Methods
-----
Data for this project come from the United States Department of Transportationâ€™s Fatality Analysis Reporting System, provided through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. These data provide information about all traffic accidents occurring on traffic-ways open to the public in the United States and resulting in at least one fatality within 30 days of the accident. The data span the years 2000 to 2015 across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, yielding a total of 551,789 accidents and 822,049 vehicles. Perhaps most importantly, this dataset provides information regarding the vehicle factors surrounding an accident, allowing us to pinpoint the proportion of accidents which were (at least in part) caused by car failure, problems which should be caught in a typical vehicle safety
inspection. 

We use a synthetic controls approach to analyze the impact of discontinuing vehicle safety inspections in New Jersey. Simply put, the synthetic controls approach constructs a weighted average of states similar to some treated state, which can be used as a "synthetic" version of the state that differs only in that it did not receive the treatment. Hence, in this case, we construct a weighted average of states that require vehicle safety inspections to create a unit of observation that mirrors New Jersey in many key variables, but that requires vehicle inspections throughout the entire range of data. Comparing this synthetic New Jersey to the actual data yields important insights into the impact of the law change.
