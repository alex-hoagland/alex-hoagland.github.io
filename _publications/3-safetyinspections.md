Abstract: An increase in technology means that vehicles are more reliable than in the past.
Accordingly, states have begun to discontinue their requirements for vehicle safety
inspections. To gauge the effect of such changes, we examine traffic fatality data from
2000 to 2015, with emphasis on New Jersey, which ended safety inspection requirements
in 2010. Utilizing a synthetic controls approach, we conclude that ending these requirements
did not result in a significant increase in the frequency or intensity of accidents
due to car failure, implying that the consumer and government expenditures used for
inspections could be reallocated to other areas of travel safety.
