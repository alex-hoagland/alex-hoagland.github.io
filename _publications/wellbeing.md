title: "In Good Company: Adolescent Well-Being and Shared Time with Neighbors, Mentors, and Friends"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/wellbeing
excerpt: 'Adolescents spend an increasing percentage of time outside of the home as they age, spending more of their time with friends, neighbors and mentors. These social and community interactions play a prominent role in long-run adolescent development, and could potentially go so far as to compensate for a lack of interaction with parents and family members for adolescents from non-nuclear homes. This study contributes the first data-driven study identifying the immediate emotional response of adolescents from varying home structures—nuclear homes, stepparent homes, and single-parent homes—as they spend time with friends, mentors, and other adults in their community.'
